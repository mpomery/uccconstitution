<h2>RobertsRules.org | Robert's Rules of Order - Summary Version</h2>
<b>For Fair and Orderly 

Meetings &amp; Conventions</b><br><br>Provides common rules and procedures for 

deliberation and debate in order to place the whole membership on the same 

footing and speaking the same language. The conduct of ALL business is 

controlled by the general will of the whole membership - the right of the 

deliberate majority to decide. Complementary is the right of at least a strong 

minority to require the majority to be deliberate - to act according to its 

considered judgment AFTER a full and fair "working through" of the issues 

involved. Robert's Rules provides for constructive and democratic meetings, to 

help, not hinder, the business of the assembly. Under no circumstances should 

"undue strictness" be allowed to intimidate members or limit full participation. 

<br><br>The fundamental right of deliberative assemblies require all questions 

to be thoroughly discussed before taking action!<br><br>The assembly rules - 

they have the final say on everything! <br>Silence means consent! 

<blockquote>

  <ul>

    <li>Obtain the floor (the right to speak) by being the first to stand when 

    the person speaking has finished; state Mr./Madam Chairman. Raising your 

    hand means nothing, and standing while another has the floor is out of 

    order! Must be recognized by the Chair before speaking! 

    </li><li>Debate can not begin until the Chair has stated the motion or resolution 

    and asked "are you ready for the question?" If no one rises, the chair calls 

    for the vote! 

    </li><li>Before the motion is stated by the Chair (the question) members may 

    suggest modification of the motion; the mover can modify as he pleases, or 

    even withdraw the motion without consent of the seconder; if mover modifies, 

    the seconder can withdraw the second. 

    </li><li>The "immediately pending question" is the last question stated by the 

    Chair! Motion/Resolution - Amendment - Motion to Postpone 

    </li><li>The member moving the "immediately pending question" is entitled to 

    preference to the floor! 

    </li><li>No member can speak twice to the same issue until everyone else wishing 

    to speak has spoken to it once! 

    </li><li>All remarks must be directed to the Chair. Remarks must be courteous in 

    language and deportment - avoid all personalities, never allude to others by 

    name or to motives! 

    </li><li>The agenda and all committee reports are merely recommendations! When 

    presented to the assembly and the question is stated, debate begins and 

    changes occur! </li></ul>
